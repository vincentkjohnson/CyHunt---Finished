Description

The main screen, described in UseCaseDescription.png, will have a list of buildings generated by the server. 
The client can touch the name of the building to show a map of where it is, and when he or she 
gets close enough to the building, the server will check the building off for the user 
and give points. If the user is not close enough, he or she will recieve a message that says 
that the user is not close enough. The faster the user can correctly go to a location and hit 
the button to check the location, the more points the user gets. The score is tracked in a 
leaderboard, and the user can see how well he or she is doing against others. 
The main goal is fulfilled when the user gets more points.
