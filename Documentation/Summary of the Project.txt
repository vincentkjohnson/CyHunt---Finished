Title: CyHunt

Project Description: 
		CyHunt is an android application, which uses geo-fencing and gps technologies
		to take students on a scavenger hunt around campus to find points of interests (POIs)
		in a short amount of time. Their time finding locations will dictate their points and
		and rank on a ranking leaderboard. Bonus points can be earned by finding Cy at 
		randomly generated locations.
					
Goals/Objectives: 
	a) 	Develop a well presented and user friendly client using Java
			i. 	Easy to use client
			ii. Clean looking and presentable
	b) 	Develop a robust server and database using Spring boot
			i. Develope multiple database/tables for: POI locations, User Logins, Leaderboards
	c) 	Incorporate GPS and geo-fencing technologies

Final Outcome: 
		A presentable application that provides entertainment in the form of a scavenger hunt
		with the use of Android, GPS, and GEO-Fencing technologies.
		
Benefits:
		Application will help new/transfering students learn the locations of buildings on 
		the Iowa State University campus and help with a easier transition to the university.
		
Limitations:
		Mobile Platform - we only have access to Android developement tools
		Mobile Hardware - we will be accessing GPS which can be a huge draw on battery power.
